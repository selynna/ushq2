										<h3>Questions and Answers</h3>
                                        
                                        <!-- FIX QUESTIONS TO THE ONES ON THE DOC -->
                                        <p>
<strong>Selynna: </strong>Can you recall a specific event that sparked your interest in the STEM field?  What caused you to consider STEM over any other major? </br>
<strong>Alicia: </strong>I’ve always been interested in learning more about how our world works. There’s honestly just so much to do in so little time. I’ve always been curious about little events and things we notice around us: why is the sky blue? How do birds fly? And all these questions can be answered through reason and STEM. All fields of STEM are so unique, but at the same time, they’re all interconnected. Mathematical models are constantly applied to Physics, Biology, and Chemistry. We can even invent new technology from all this new information. It’s human nature to seek out answers to our questions and to find methods to improve our own lives.
</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Selynna: </strong>What influenced you to lead the WiSTEM club at LAHS? What other STEM events/activities did you participate in in high school? </br>
<strong>Alicia: </strong>WiSTEM has always encouraged young women to enter the STEM field, which often seems intimidating for a lot of people. While our school offers math classes, Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Forensics, Environmental Science, Comp Sci and even Engineering, WiSTEM helps students, especially girls, to recognize their interests and work at pursuing them further. Many people tend to shy away from STEM fields, because they appear challenging. Because I personally am interested in STEM, I want to help and encourage others to have experiences with STEM that they usually cannot get in the high school setting. </p>
                                <p>
<strong>Selynna: </strong>Did the male-dominant nature of the STEM field ever cause you to consider not pursuing this career? </br>
<strong>Alicia: </strong>This has always been a sensitive topic. While some may argue that men outperform women when it comes to any STEM field, it has become clear to me that once you have proven your passion and ability in a particular field, whether it be male-dominated or not, people will respect you for it. As long as you stay true to a career that you truly support and love, I don’t think any adversity will affect you in the long run. 
 </p> 
                                <p><strong>Selynna: </strong></stron>What’s your favorite part of being involved in the STEM field?  Can you recall a specific event that really caused you to appreciate your career?</br>
                                <strong>Alicia: </strong>I think it’s just amazing to see where humans are at right now in comparison to centuries ago. We are surrounded by so many new advances in medicine and technology. It goes to show how impressive the human spirit is. It even comes to the point that in the near future, individuals who had been paralyzed due to a car accident or chronic disease can have the ability to move with the help of robotic hands. I think what really pushes me forward in the STEM field is how hard it is to tear down the human spirit. We are always seeking to improve our own lives and the lives of others.
</p>
<p><strong>Selynna: </strong>What are you planning to pursue in college that is related to STEM?
</br>

<strong>Alicia: </strong>I am planning on entering the medical field. The human body has always fascinated me. It’s like a masterpiece of nature: it has the ability to repair itself, and even think for itself. Microscopic cells are able to collectively join together to accomplish things unrivaled in nature. For example, nerve impulses can travel 120 meters per second. I was born prematurely, and it was only with the advances that were made by the pioneers of medicine who were able to make it possible for me to even be here today. I want to contribute to this field wholeheartedly and help others: to show that through sheer determination, it is possible to conquer difficult challenges.

</p>
                <p><strong>Selynna: </strong>How do you feel about the gender imbalance in STEM professions?</br>
<strong>Alicia: </strong>Look at #3 - While there is a gender imbalance in STEM professions, I’ve talked to many females with STEM professions who are not affected by the gender imbalance that exists. They have been welcomingly embraced by the people they work with. It goes to show that what is most important is not an individual’s gender, but rather their true passion to contribute to a STEM field. It’s not that girls aren’t interested in science, it’s society that’s limiting them.

</p> 
                <p>        <strong>Selynna: </strong>Do you have any ideas on how to encourage more girls/women to join the STEM field? If you were told a girl was interested in STEM, how would you encourage them to join in? </br>
<strong>Alicia: </strong>If anyone (she or he) is interested in any kind of STEM field, it is important to let your passions, and not social norms discourage him/her. If you are interested in a STEM field, just remember that there are numerous opportunities available. For example, I would recommend searching online for any speakers/events in the Bay Area. Seek out any internship programs. Getting a firsthand experience in a lab or around professionals in the field is always a great way to get even more interested. You’ll be able to interact with people who are extremely passionate about their careers. 
 </p>
<p><strong>Selynna: </strong>What do you think about the statement “Kids quit STEM because they think they’re too stupid?”</br>
<strong>Alicia: </strong>It is important to note that, more often than not, we’ll meet challenges along the way, especially in the STEM fields. Those who have pure grit --the willingness to pick themselves up and work even harder--are the ones who will succeed. Intelligence is not a substantial measure of an individual’s success in the STEM field. I truly believe that perseverance will always trump intelligence. It’s the difference between those quit and those who remain loyal to their passions. While this may sound cliche, you should never. never give up a career if you are truly interested in it.
