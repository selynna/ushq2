												<h3>The Gender Gap</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Men have traditionally dominated the STEM field, and still are.  Only 33% of the people in a STEM career are women, and people are doing all they can to lessen that gap.  Although other majors like social sciences have a female majority, it is still pretty evenly split, compared to STEM.  </p>

												<h3>The difference in wages</h3>
											</header>
											<p>It has been proven that women in STEM fields earn 33% more than their non-STEM counterparts.  The skillset is completely different and is completely different than that of social sciences.  Although women in STEM may earn less than men, 14% less to be exact, it is still greater overall when compared to women in non-STEM fields.  If you are passionate about some aspect of STEM, sticking with a field that is male dominated is worth it if you want to be able to support a family and have fun at the same time.</p>

												<h3>A comparison to men</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Throughout the ages, in history and now, many  men have had a certain superiority complex towards women.  That women are worse, that they are inferior: it all ties into the fact that women would be denied equality in government and in opportunities.  When free white men were able to vote since the founding of our country, it was not until 1820 that women were able to vote, although inequality was still prevalent.   </p>
											<p>We see this inequality today as well, especially in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) field.  The gender ratio, comparatively, is extremely high when compared to that of other fields, like social sciences.  Even though here in the Bay Area, Silicon Valley is flourishing with cutting-edge technology and innovation, gender inequality is still something we see daily.  </p>
											<p>Silicon Valley is the birthplace of huge companies like Google and Facebook, yet out of all these companies, the lack of women is incredibly obvious.  One step into Google's headquarters shows you how outnumbered women are in this STEM field.  As this issue gets bigger and bigger, we see more instances of women giving teens the opportunity to experience this field and to equalize the gender ratio.  Reshma Saujani, founder of a program called Girls Who Code, has actively taken steps to bring girls aged 13-17 into computer science.  However, despite the efforts of many women like Saujani, girls are still discriminated against, like Lisa Su, the first woman CEO of AMD, a computer chip company, who is paid a whole $250,000 less than her predecessor in yearly salary.  </p>
