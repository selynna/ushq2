                                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gender inequality has been prevalent in society as far as history dates back.  It is clear that there was some heavy discrimination, the female count of Nobel Prizes related to STEM fields, as an example.  Only <strong>16</strong> out of 357 people winning STEM-related Nobel Prizes are <strong>women</strong>.  This is less than 5% of the people who have won STEM-related Nobel Prizes.  Women make up half of the world's population and we are just as capable as men.  There is no reason for the percentage of women winning prizes to be so low.  To quote Mary Ann Liebert, the founder of the Rosalind Franklin Society, a group that advocates for more women Nobel Prize winners, "Men tend not to nominate them, and women don't nominate themselves," Liebert told NPR."  This shows how passive most women are in fixing this gender equality problem - no one steps up for women, and most don't even step up for themselves.  </p>
                                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite not standing up often, women are still seen to have protested heavily for their rights and general equality, some of which have resulted in huge benefits for women, through suffrage movements both big and small.  These suffrage movements popped up due to discrimination and the want for more rights and freedoms.  As an example, Alice Paul was a major suffragist in the 20th century, seen to have protested heavily for her cause.  Even with the suffrage movements, there are still many traces of gender inequality, mostly caused some variation of a superiority complex by men who believed that women were less capable.  However, the gender inequality in STEM started to become more obvious after the technology boom, since there were just so many more men willing to work in the field compared to women.</p>
                                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women were also given less opportunities for education, mostly through societal expectation.  The idea was that women should keep the house orderly and neat and that they should learn to be good wives, rather than learn to be educated individuals.  All STEM fields require some sort of education, and women could not dive into that field without proper credentials.  This led to more and more inequality, to the point where the number of men in the STEM fields clearly outweighed the number of women.  This still holds true today, as statistics show that out of 100 women that join the STEM field and recieve a bachelor's degree, only 3 of those women work in STEM after 10 years.  STEM fields have rigorous education standards, however, this shouldn't be reason for women to drop out.  Women should be <strong>encouraged</strong> to continue their education despite all their failures.</p>
                                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also an increasing prevalence in peer influence that leads women to quit their STEM careers, if they pursue that at all.  Most women in STEM are in a field where there are so much more men and much more people that may be more capable than them.  This is not a reason to quit a field.  Just because a woman may feel inferior to those around her and is concerned with the lack of females, women are still capable, most likely more capable of some of the men around them.  There have been studies conducted that do show that some kids quit STEM because they feel as if they're too "stupid" for the field.  However, this is not true, because the person that can determine if you are capable in doing well in a highly intensive field like STEM is yourself.  More information about this issue towards STEM can be found <a href = "http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/11/too-many-kids-quit-science-because-they-dont-think-theyre-smart/382165/?utm_content=buffered46f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer">here</a>.  </p>
