									<p>There have been many attempts to solve gender inequality throughout history, no matter recent or ancient.  For ages, women have been trying to gain more rights and equality for themselves and their posterity.</p>
									<p>
                                        Reshma Saujani is a prime example of a woman trying to attempt to solve this problem, though rather successfully.  She started an organization called Girls Who Code, which aims to get girls exposed to computer science.  It's actually relatively sucessful because almost all the girls that participated are interested in starting new computer science projects and are planning on majoring/minoring in it in college!  Even more so, this is a local project that aims to help minority girls around the Bay Area, where STEM field inequality is incredibly prevalent.

</p>
                                    <p>However, there have been past attempts to solve this problem throughout history.  Suffrage movements, for example, have been done solely for the benefits of women and for their equality with men.  The 19th Amendment came to fruition after women protested daily outside the White House, and after the main suffragist Alice Paul went through with hunger strikes and various torturing.  Another instance of women fighting for their equality is the time before the Equal Pay Act of 1963 was passed.  Because women were paid much less than men, they argued that they should get the same amount of pay for the same amount of labor.  Studies showed that men were happier than women because they were paid more and they are seen to get more benefits in the workplace, and this still holds true today.  However, the Equal Pay Act was the first step towards getting workplace equality for women.</p>
