                                    <p><strong>Selynna: </strong></srong>Can you recall a specific event that sparked your interest in the STEM field?</br>
<strong>Tiffany: </strong>Honestly, not really. From a young age, I’ve been really interested in entrepreneurship and just building cool things to improve peoples’ lives. 
</p>
<p> <strong>Selynna: </strong>Did the male-dominant nature of the startups and the general STEM field ever cause you to consider not pursuing your current path?</br>
<strong>Tiffany: </strong>No. I’m pretty confident that I have what it takes to succeed regardless of my gender. </p>

<p><strong>Selynna: </strong>What’s your favorite part of being involved in the STEM field?</br>
<strong>Tiffany: </strong>The welcoming community of smart and like-minded people. </p>

<p><strong>Selynna: </strong>What influenced you to co-found Glimpse?</br>
<strong>Tiffany: </strong>There is no platform out there that truly lets groups of friends safely communicate with each other. </p>

<p><strong>Selynna: </strong>What were some of the difficulties when you co-founded your startup?</br>
<strong>Tiffany: </strong>Off the top of my head: working remotely, balancing my time between Glimpse and school, raising money, and recruiting team members. </p>

<p><strong>Selynna: </strong>How do you feel about the gender imbalance in STEM professions? </br>
<strong>Tiffany: </strong>I haven’t personally encountered any problems dealing with sexism in this industry but I’ve had friends who have and it pains me. I want to turn this around but this isn’t really something us girls can do. There’s this quote I saved from some time ago that’s relevant: “I meet a lot of men who aren’t intending to be sexist, but are willfully ignorant about what goes on.” </p>

<p><strong>Selynna: </strong>Do you have any ideas on how to encourage more girls/women to join the STEM field? If you were told a girl was interested in STEM, how would you encourage them to join in? </br>
<strong>Tiffany: </strong>I’d personally give her advice and help her out by providing her with lots of resources, such as introducing her to experienced friends in the fields/industries she’s interested in. In addition, I’d send her this page to look at -- http://www.femalefounderstories.com/ :) </p>

<p><strong>Selynna: </strong>What do you think about the statement “Kids quit STEM because they think they’re too stupid?” </br>
<strong>Tiffany: </strong>That’s awful. I believe it has something to do with our education system as well as teachers’ behaviors. At a young age, teachers blatantly show that they favor certain students, which then results in some of these “exceptional” kids slacking off later in life. Teachers and parents should not praise kids for their talent, intelligence, or grades but instead for their effort, perseverance, and hard work.
