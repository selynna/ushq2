									<p><strong>Selynna: </strong>Can you recall a specific event that sparked your interest in the STEM field? </br>
                                <strong>Madeline: </strong>I got interested in physics in high school, like I took a great class when I was a junior--it was like our generic physics class--and then I took AP physics when I was a senior. But when I was a junior, I… got really interested in the sciences, and up until that point, I thought I was just going to music school to be a cellist, period. So I ended up going and [completing] a double major during my undergraduate for cello and physics, and was always sort of wondering how you could combine these two things. I had a really great mentor during my undergraduate who helped point me toward research questions about music, like having to do with certain behaviors change when you’re listening to different kinds of music, how performers change their behaviors under different playing conditions, and I guess that was when I sort of realized that this was even a field because it’s not common for a university to have a whole department or something like that that’s devoted to music psychology, which was the case at my undergraduate. </p>
<p><strong>Selynna: </strong>Did the male-dominant nature of the general STEM field ever cause you to consider not pursuing your current path?</br>
                <strong>Madeline: </strong>I’ve had a good experience. This is a male-dominated department… actually at the PHD level it’s half and half between the genders… the masters students--it’s a male population, and the class that I’m TAing right now has 50 students and like 8 women. But that said, when I’m helping a student it doesn’t matter if it’s a male or a female--it’s somebody that needs help. And I’ve certainly been in positions where I know what’s going on in the class and my students… are learning, so in terms of teaching in the STEM field, I’ve had a good experience in that the male students still respect me because I know the material. And my advisor here is female, my advisor for undergraduate was a male but… it was like gender didn’t enter into the scene, he treated me just as well if not better than some of his male students because I was working really hard. I was really prepared. If there’s any advice that I can give, I got really lucky with my undergraduate mentor. I don’t think I was looking for somebody who was gender-fair… but I would say by being kind of a “go-getter,” people will see that and make opportunities for you… And the kind of person who will see that and who will make an opportunity for you, that’s the kind of person you want as your mentor.
</p>
<p><strong>Selynna: </strong>What’s your favorite part of being involved in the STEM field?</br>
<strong>Madeline: </strong>I enjoy the high standards of the sciences - the ethics, the details that other scientists are interested in, and the need to
really pick and choose research questions that will move the field
forward. While I don't doubt that you can find similarly high
standards in every field that you might look at, the sciences really
rely on everyone reaching for those high standards. It's how the field
advances in a reliable way, and I enjoy contributing to that scrutiny
and trust.</p>
<p><strong>Selynna: </strong>What is working in a Stanford lab like?</br>
<strong>Madeline: </strong>My lab at Stanford is new - it just opened this year - so the community of students working in it is just now growing. In that way,
my lab experience may be nontraditional, but its really neat to be
present at the beginnings of the music psychology and neuroscience
group that is budding here at CCRMA (the Center for Computer Research
in Music and Acoustics). On a day-to--day basis though, I usually get
to the lab at some point during the day - either early in the morning
or later in the evening, mostly to analyze data from an experiment I
did last year. I meet with my advisor around once per week or every
other week to discuss findings, and to plan upcoming work. I enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>Selynna: </strong>What were some of the difficulties you experienced when you started working at CCRMA?</br>
<strong>Madeline:</strong>I had only taken one programming class before starting my PhD, and though I felt highly qualified in terms of my music experience (I'm a
serious cellist and pianist), many of my assignments last year
included programming in various languages - mostly MATLAB and ChucK.
While I did feel a bit trapped at first, since I had musical ideas
that I couldn't quite communicate using the required languages due to
inexperience, I took two programming classes in the CS department -
the main intro sequence for undergrads actually! - and feel
sufficiently caught up. I'm always learning, and there are still
stronger coders in my department than me, but we all have our
strengths and weaknesses and end up helping each other with various
aspects of different projects.</p>
<p><strong>Selynna: </strong>What are you most excited for in the future of STEM?</br>
<strong>Madeline: </strong>I can speak to the arts and STEM. Do you guys know the acronym STEAM instead? There have been some musicians and artists who have tried to extend STEM to STEAM, with an A in there for the arts. And this has gotten some traction. Like my mom teaches at an elementary school in New York and their “Gifted and Talented” program actually got renamed to “STEAM” program. That’s an interesting topic… I like the idea of STEAM getting traction because here we are in a music department, but we all consider ourselves scientists and we’re publishing in science journals, we’re publishing in technology journals. And I think STEM is continuing to diversify and acknowledge the kind of work this department does is comparably scientific or technological to the kind of work that… is done in the computer science department. And I think having it continue that way would be really nice. Because I’m graduating with a music degree but I do consider myself to be a scientist and I think that as long as the people who actually graduate with the PHDs in physics and the PHDs in other hard sciences continue to be inclusive, then we can continue to talk to those communities and continue to get their input… because music psychology does not live in a bubble from the actual psychology community. So recognition from actual psychologists that music psychology is an area of interest and should be included in their conversations--that would be really nice.</p>

</p><strong>Selynna</strong>Do you have any ideas on how to encourage more girls/women to join the STEM field? </br>
<strong>Madeline: </strong>When thinking about the topic 'women in STEM', I often think about my days in high school honestly, when I was unabashed in pursuing my interests and the topic of gender imbalances rarely came up. I just
studied what I wanted! I think, if you enter a situation where there
is a gender imbalance, just continue to channel your high school self:
if you're interested in the material, learn more about it, pursue it.

That said, that is just a personal mindset that I think may help. In
general, seeing and having female mentors, scientists naturally equal
and competitive in their field (like my advisor this year, and my
advisor during my masters!), will help women in science through
leading by example. Maybe you or I will be an example someday!</p>
<p><strong>Selynna: </strong>If you were told a girl was interested in STEM, how would you encourage them to join in? </br>
<strong>Madeline: </strong>A lot of the joy in STEM for me, is working on individualized projects. Brainstorming different project ideas, and getting students on track to spend time getting deep into a question and a method to
answer it, would be very valuable time spent I think, for both
genders. I taught a music cognition class this past summer where the
first assignment was: "If you could only ask three questions about
music in your life, what would they be?" And then we spent time
reading research papers that tried to answer similar questions to what
they asked. This would be a way many would get started on trying to
find a valuable research question, and the students seemed to like
this activity. I think delving into specific questions and 'getting
our hands dirty', so-to-speak, is the best way to encourage continued
participation, for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Selynna: </strong>What do you think about the statement “Kids quit STEM because they think they’re too stupid?” </br>
<strong>Madeline: </strong>Sadly, I think there is some truth to this statement, but it may be just as much a product of the grading system at universities as it is people's mindsets. During my undergraduate, I worked on a STEM
education project where one of the questions was why students leave
STEM early. Much of the answer nodded to grade inflation in other
fields, and how STEM fields still give out grads on a bell curve - the
majority of the class may get B's. When you are a student getting A's
in your other classes, but in your one STEM class your first semester,
you get a B-, you may think that you're not as good in that field as
you are in others. But don't be too mislead by the letter on your
transcript. You may need time to develop study skills for college
science classes (do as many practice problems as you can - it will
help!), and a bit more time to decide if you really truly like the
material. I think allowing yourself this time, sometimes in spite of
the letter grade, will give you a more nuanced view of your own
interests, and what fields you want to work at.
