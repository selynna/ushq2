					<h2>Interview with <strong>Katherine Liu</strong></h2>
					<p>Katherine is currently a student at Stanford University pursuing computer science and graduated from LAHS in 2014.  In high school, she founded the Women in STEM (WiSTEM) Club, which really helped advocate gender equality in STEM here at school.  Some of her work can be seen on her<a href="https://katherineliu.me"> website.</a></p>

										<h3>Questions and Answers</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
<strong>Selynna: </strong>Can you recall a specific event that sparked your interest in the STEM field?  What caused you to consider STEM over any other major? </br>
<strong>Katherine: </strong>I’ve always loved making things, and for a lot of different areas in STEM, that’s what is at their core – creating. I think there are just so many incredible aspects to explore in STEM, it’s really hard to narrow it down to one specific thing I’d like to major in, so I’m still exploring within the science and engineering fields. It’s a really interesting time for technology in general, and the building/making facet is just wonderful. 
</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Selynna: </strong>What influenced you to charter the WiSTEM club at LAHS? What other STEM events/activities did you participate in in high school? </br>
<strong>Katherine: </strong>I found that while LAHS did have some science/math clubs on campus, their memberships were predominantly male – there wasn’t really a place on campus for girls to come together and share their stories and ideas about STEM. It’s really sad to realize how many potential scientists and engineers never pursue their interests because girls are told that boys are inherently better at subjects like math and engineering, which has no scientific basis at all. It’s actually a pretty big debate – whether we should have women-only STEM events, and whether they’re beneficial or detrimental – but I think it’s important, at this point, to have kind of a “safe space” where women can support other women in pursuing their interests in STEM.
In high school, I shadowed at ophthalmology clinics (which was absolutely incredible) and also dived into a lot of research (I did bio research for a summer in Boston, and did more computer science/bioengineering research the next summer), just to see what that world was like. I think academic research is really important, but it wasn’t really my jam, so I also tried internships with different tech startups to explore a variety of things. I also spent my free time running a biotech blog (bioinnovate.tumblr.com) and taking different MOOCs on topics like mobile healthcare and creative programming. </p>
                                <p>
<strong>Selynna: </strong>Did the male-dominant nature of the STEM field ever cause you to consider not pursuing this career? </br>
<strong>Katherine: </strong>Not really – my family has always been super supportive of anything I’m interested in, and I think that played a huge part in why I’ve never been afraid to dive deeper into STEM. Things have also gotten (slightly) better over time, now that (slightly) more people are cognizant about the importance of diversity in STEM and there are groups that specifically focus on supporting women in science and engineering. </p> 
                                <p><strong>Selynna: </strong></stron>What’s your favorite part of being involved in the STEM field?  Can you recall a specific event that really caused you to appreciate your career?</br>
                                <strong>Katherine: </strong>I love art and design (design is my one true love), and I think my favorite part about STEM is that it’s so flexible – I can combine my interests in science and art, and there’s not really a barrier between the two as is commonly perceived. There are also just so many important problems to be solved – biotechnology is just incredible, I think it’s going to be “the next big thing,” as people say. Personalized medicine, 3D printing of viruses – it’s just so fascinating, it’s impossible not to get drawn in. </p>
<p><strong>Selynna: </strong>What do you believe to be the next step in your career with regard to your computer science major?</br>
<strong>Katherine: </strong>I’m still taking time to explore the different options at Stanford – there are so many things I want to learn about, I have to remind myself not to limit myself too early on. Computer science, or more specifically web development, is just incredibly exciting because it has such a natural leaning toward creativity, and it’s an extension of my love for design. There is also an amazing variety of applications for computer science – I hope to explore deeper into using CS for biotechnology and medicine, where I think a lot of advances are going to be happening in the near future and where we can really help make a difference for people. 
</p>
                <p><strong>Selynna: </strong>How do you feel about the gender imbalance in STEM professions?</br>
<strong>Katherine: </strong>It shouldn’t exist. In every field, it’s so critical to have diversity – you can’t build products or do anything super meaningful if it’s only coming from and serving a single perspective. And there is no basis behind the idea that men might be better than women at STEM-related activities – a lot depends on accumulated advantage, and that’s something we need to actively encourage in girls who are interested in science. 
</p> 
                <p>        <strong>Selynna: </strong>Do you have any ideas on how to encourage more girls/women to join the STEM field? If you were told a girl was interested in STEM, how would you encourage them to join in? </br>
<strong>Katherine: </strong>Support at a young age is so (soooo) important, because little things really do build up – having older girls support younger girls in STEM is one great way to kickstart interest, and just giving them mentorship and guidance can make a huge difference. If a girl came up to me and told me she was interested in STEM, I would say “That’s great! You should get involved in anything related at school and pursue whatever you think is the most fascinating, despite what other people might say. Here’s a list of places you can go that you might find interesting...” And it’s important that they find a great community of friends in science, too – collaboration and the sharing of ideas is part of what makes STEM so amazing. </p>
<p><strong>Selynna: </strong>What do you think about the statement “Kids quit STEM because they think they’re too stupid?”</br>
<strong>Katherine: </strong>It’s relatable – there have been plenty of times when I’ve felt uncomfortable in a STEM class because I didn’t feel like I was at the same level as my peers. I think it really comes down to chasing what you’re interested in, and ignoring what other people might say. It’s also a question of previous exposure and mentorship – I can’t stress enough how crucial it is to start exploring early, and how important it is to have a great mentor who supports you and gives you guidance at every step.
